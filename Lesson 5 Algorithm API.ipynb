    "#The next step will be to build a basic structure for our trading algorithm using Quantopian's Algorithm API. The Algorithm API provides functions that facilitate order scheduling and execution, and allow us to initialize and manage parameters in our algorithms.\n",
    "#Let's take a look at some of the core functions we will use in our algorithm:\n",
    "\"\"\"initialize(context)\n",
    "initialize is called exactly once when our algorithm starts running and requires context as input. Any parameter initialization and one-time startup logic should go here.\n",
    "context is an augmented Python dictionary used for maintaining state throughout the simulation process, and can be referenced in different parts of our algorithm. Any variables that we want to persist between function calls should be stored in context instead of using global variables. Context variables can be accessed and initialized using dot notation (context.some_attribute).\n",
    "before_trading_start(context, data)\n",
    "before_trading_start is called once per day before the market opens and requires context and data as input. context is a reference to the same dictionary from initialize, and data is an object that stores several API functions that allow us to look up current or historical pricing and volume data for any asset.\n",
    "before_trading_start is also where we get our pipeline's output, and do any pre-processing of the resulting data before using it for portfolio construction. We will cover this in the next lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "schedule_function(func, day_rule, time_rule)\n",
    "\n",

    "Next, let's build a skeleton for our trading algorithm. For now we will have our algorithm keep track of the number of days that have passed in the simulation and log different messages depending on the date and time. In the next couple of lessons we will integrate our data pipeline and add trading logic.\n",
